# Intstructions

Install packages with `pipenv install`

Run with `pipenv run uvicorn main:app --reload`

Learn the `fastapi` library from `https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/`

Use the `Rest Client` extension from VS Code to make testing the API easier

## Recommended Work

1. Try creating an API where you can pass in an image of a Blackpink member, have your trained machine learning model predict who the member is, and have the result sent back to the user.
2. Create a server that connects different 3rd-party APIs together like any weather API, Twitter API, Twilio API, etc.
