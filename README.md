## Introduction

Welcome to the workshop series. This repository contains all of our labs. You are not required to do any of them, but following along will ensure that you are going to get something out of this workshop series.

We will start with the basics of Python, then follow it up with the `requests` library, then we'll train our own machine learning model, and finally we will set up a REST API. That will be 4 weeks of labs, and for another 2 more weeks you will do your own software project using some of the concepts you learned here.
